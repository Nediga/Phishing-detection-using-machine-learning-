# Project Description:

Abstract—Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it difficult to predict them using traditional security measures. One technique that has gained traction is leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify phishing websites. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to predict phishing attempts by analyzing website updates. Our approach uses a dataset of legitimate and phishing websites to train an XGBoost classifier to identify changes in web pages that could indicate a phishing attempt. Specifically, we analyze the changes made to web pages that are typically targeted by phishers, such as login pages, and compare them against the changes made to legitimate websites. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves high prediction rates with low false positive rates. We believe that our approach could be an effective addition to traditional security measures for predicting phishing attempts.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:

The goal of this study was to predict phishing websites using machine learning techniques. Three well-known algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost, were tested, and their performance was assessed using a variety of measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among these algorithms, we discovered that XGBoost had the greatest accuracy of 100% in predicting phishing websites.

We have included two significant functions, namely SSL Certificate analysis and website update analysis, to enhance the efficacy of our model. By taking into account a number of sub-features, including the certificate's authenticity, the encryption's power, and the digital signature, SSL Certificate analysis enabled us to evaluate if a webpage is real or not. On the other side, website update analysis gave us the ability to identify phishing schemes by scrutinizing a number of sub-features such as URL length, update frequency, and size, content similarity before and after changes, and user feedback.
